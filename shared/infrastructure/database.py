"""Shared database infrastructure for the Smart Band Edge Service.

Provides a single :class:`peewee.SqliteDatabase` instance (``db``) shared by
the bounded contexts' ORM mappings, so they use the same database.

The :func:`init_db` function is called during application startup to open the
configured database and create any missing tables with Peewee's
``safe=True`` option.

Note:
    The ``db`` object is configured before :func:`init_db` connects it.
    Peewee manages connections using thread-local storage; the Flask
    application closes the active connection during teardown.
